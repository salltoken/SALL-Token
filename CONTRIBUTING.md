# Contributing to SALL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SALL ecosystem. This repository is open to serious contributors who can deliver measurable work across protocol, infrastructure, security, AI/data, governance tooling, and related system layers.

## 1) How to Contribute (Simple Path)
1. Review the repository and open issues.
2. Select an issue that matches your expertise.
3. Comment on the issue with:
   - your proposed approach,
   - estimated delivery timeline,
   - any dependencies or open questions.
4. Once aligned, submit a pull request and keep progress visible through the issue thread.

## 2) What We’re Looking For
We prioritize contributors who actively build, secure, govern, scale, or structurally enable the ecosystem, including:

- Core engineering (backend, distributed systems, infrastructure)
- Protocol and smart contract engineering
- Security engineering, cryptography, audits, threat modeling
- AI/ML and data infrastructure
- Governance and DAO tooling
- Tokenomics engineering support (modeling and simulation as deliverables)
- Platform reliability (DevOps/SRE, CI/CD, observability)

## 3) Token Partnership Program (Contribution-Based)
Some contributors may be considered for participation in the Token Partnership Program.

Key principles:
- Contribution is delivery-based and milestone-driven.
- There is no upfront payment under the token-only contributor lane.
- No token allocation, compensation, or entitlement is created by contributing unless confirmed in a separate written agreement.
- Any token-related arrangement, if applicable, is defined case-by-case and subject to internal approval and separate documentation.

If you wish to be considered under the Token Partnership Program, indicate this clearly in your issue comment and include:
- links to relevant work (GitHub, audits, deployments, research),
- your availability,
- and your preferred contribution scope.

## 4) Scope Matching / Direct Contact

- 2–3 links to representative work,
- the area of this repository you wish to contribute to,
- estimated weekly capacity.

## 5) Standards
- Keep pull requests focused and reviewable.
- Clearly document what was changed and why.
- Prefer tests where applicable.
- Marketing, token speculation, or promotional content is not accepted.

## 6) Professional Conduct
All contributors are expected to maintain professional, respectful communication. Misrepresentation, low-integrity behavior, or abuse will result in removal from the contribution process.
